# Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "loveleetcode"

# Output: 2

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "aabb"

# Output: -1

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s consists of only lowercase English letters.
